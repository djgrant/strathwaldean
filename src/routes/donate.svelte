  If you’d like to contribute a small amount towards the project (£20
  suggested), this will be really helpful in helping cover the cost of equipment
  hire, and, later down the line, materials for building things like benches,
  pathways, a pizza oven etc.
</p>

<p>
  As we don’t have a bank account for the quad or anything fancy like that, we
  are asking people if they’d like to make a pledge and then just collecting
  funds as they are required.
</p>

<p>
  Crucially, this gives us an idea of how much money there is available to work
  with to develop the quad.
