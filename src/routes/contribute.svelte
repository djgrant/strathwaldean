  <p>
    If you’d like to contribute a small amount towards the project (£20
    suggested), this will be really helpful in helping cover the cost of
    equipment hire, and, later down the line, plants, benches, pathways etc.
  </p>

  <p>
    As we don’t have a bank account for the quad or anything fancy like that, we
    are asking people if they’d like to make a pledge and then just collecting
    funds as they are required.
  </p>

  <p>
    Crucially, this gives us an idea of how much money there is available to
    work with to develop the quad.

    If you’d like to help in this way, please
